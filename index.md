            <bold id="start">What is a Sandwich?</bold> This is a question that everyone in 
            their lifetime has asked themselves at least once. There is only ONE answer to this 
            question. Sandwich IS The Food of Gods. Creating a perfect sandwich is a very sophisticated
            multi-step process. A sandwich is a food typically consisting of vegetables, sliced cheese or meat, 
            placed on or between slices of bread, or more generally any dish wherein bread serves as a container 
            or wrapper for another food type. The sandwich began as a portable, convenient finger food in 
            the Western world, though over time it has become prevalent worldwide. In the 21st century there has been 
            considerable debate over the precise definition of sandwich; and specifically whether a hot dog or open 
            sandwich can be categorized as such. In the United States, the Department of Agriculture and the Food and 
            Drug Administration are the responsible agencies. The USDA uses the definition, "at least 35% cooked meat 
            and no more than 50% bread" for closed sandwiches, and "at least 50% cooked meat" for open sandwiches. 
            In Britain, the British Sandwich Association defines a sandwich as "any form of bread with a filling, 
            generally assembled cold", a definition which includes wraps and bagels, but excludes dishes assembled and 
            served hot, such as burgers. Sandwiches are a popular type of lunch food, taken to work, school, or picnics 
            to be eaten as part of a packed lunch. The bread may be plain or be coated with condiments, such as mayonnaise 
            or mustard, to enhance its flavour and texture. As well as being homemade, sandwiches are also widely sold in 
            various retail outlets and can be served hot or cold. There are both savoury sandwiches, such as deli meat 
            sandwiches, and sweet sandwiches, such as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The sandwich is named after its 
            supposed inventor, John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich. The Wall Street Journal has described it as Britain's 
            "biggest contribution to gastronomy". If you are very invested into learning more about sandwichology I would
